        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
                This privacy policy explains how Murat Can Çiçek ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects the data of users ("you") of the Bloom ("Application") mobile application. By using our Application, you agree to the data practices described in this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We need to collect certain information to perform the core functions of our Application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> The photos you take or select from your gallery to identify a plant using the Application. These photos are processed solely for the purpose of carrying out the identification process. Since there is no user account system in the Application, photos are not associated with your personal account. Your photos are not stored on our servers after the analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous usage data may be collected to improve the performance of the Application and to detect potential errors. This data may include technical information such as your device model, operating system version, and in-app crash reports. This data does not personally identify you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide Application Services:</strong> To process the photos you submit and to offer plant identification and "Botanical Assistant" features.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Application:</strong> To analyze usage data to enhance the user experience, fix bugs, and plan new features.</li>
            <li><strong>To Provide Support:</strong> To assist you when you contact us through the "Contact Us" section in the Settings menu.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our Application utilizes trusted third-party services to provide its functionality. These services have their own privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PlantNet API:</strong> Used for the plant identification service. Images sent for identification are processed by this service. You can access the PlantNet privacy policy <a href="https://plantnet.org/en/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Google (Gemini API):</strong> Provides the artificial intelligence infrastructure behind our "Botanical Assistant" feature and the creation of detailed plant guides. Your queries and the context are processed by this service. You can access Google's privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Used to monitor application performance and collect anonymous analytics, such as crash reports. Firebase is a Google service.</li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage premium subscriptions and in-app purchases. Your payment transactions are managed directly by Apple; RevenueCat does not see your payment information, it only anonymously manages your subscription status. You can access RevenueCat's privacy policy <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take the security of your data seriously and implement industry-standard security measures (such as the infrastructure provided by Firebase) to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our Application is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to delete such information immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
